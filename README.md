# Shell-Scripting-Practise

## About

This is a repository to track my practise shell-scripts. Will update the repo as and when I learn new things. 

For now, feel free to poke around!

Suggestions are always welcome!

## Running The Scripts

All you need is a terminal to get going with scripting. 

If you would like to try these scripts out yourself, follow these steps:

+ Launch terminal and `cd` into the required directory.
+ Run the command `git clone https://github.com/skandaprasad/Shell-Scripting-Practise/`
+ Use any editor like `nano`, `gedit`, `vim`, `vscode` or anything of your choice to make any changes of your own.
+ Save your changes and switch tabs to terminal again.
+ Run the command `./FILENAME.sh`
+ For the scripts requiring arguements to be passed, use `./FILENAME.sh ARGUMENT1 ARGUMENT2` and so on.
+ For scripts requiring multiple user inputs, give a `space`, do not use `enter` key.
